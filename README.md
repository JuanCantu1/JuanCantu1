## 📌 Who I Am

I’m a **Master’s student in Electrical Engineering (MSEE)** at UTRGV with a **B.S. in Computer Engineering**. My work and interests focus on **digital hardware design and RTL development**, especially **FPGA/ASIC design**, **computer architecture**, and **system-level integration**.

I enjoy building practical hardware projects that reinforce strong fundamentals, ranging from **CPU microarchitecture and pipelined datapaths** to **FSM-driven FPGA designs** and **real-time signal processing systems**. I’m especially interested in designing digital systems that are **clean, efficient, and scalable**, with an emphasis on writing structured **Verilog/SystemVerilog** and developing designs that are easy to debug and verify.
