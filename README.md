## 📌 Who I Am

I'm a **Computer Engineer**, **Research Assistant**, and current **Master’s student in Electrical Engineering** at UTRGV. I blend **hardware design** and **machine learning** to solve real-world challenges, thriving at the intersection of embedded systems, FPGAs, and intelligent computation.

From simulating custom RISC pipelines to designing real-time DSP systems for audio enhancement, I focus on building efficient, impactful systems that bridge theory and application.

I believe in **engineering for impact** — building systems that are fast, intelligent, and meaningful.
