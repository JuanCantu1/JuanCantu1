## 📌 Who I Am

I'm a **Master’s student in Electrical Engineering** at UTRGV. I hold a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering** from UTRGV, where I built a strong foundation in digital design, computer architecture, and embedded systems.

My interests center on **FPGA, ASIC/VLSI, and front-end digital design**, with a focus on RTL development, CPU architectures, and system-on-chip integration. I am passionate about semiconductor technologies and high-performance digital systems that power modern computing.

I enjoy building hardware that bridges **theory and practice**, from custom RISC-V CPU pipelines and transistor-level VLSI circuits to FPGA-based accelerators and real-time DSP systems. My goal is to design systems that are **fast, efficient, and scalable**, contributing to the next generation of computing hardware and semiconductor innovation.

I believe in **engineering with purpose**: using hardware design to push the boundaries of performance while enabling meaningful real-world applications.
